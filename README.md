## [Hardware Interfaces for VR Applications: Evaluation on Prototypes](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7363283)

This paper starts by introducing VR and outlining the criteria for an effective Virtual Reality System. It is absolutely vital that users feel completely immersed in the world so that they don't feel like they're just playing a game. The next part of the paper goes into the different forms of mixed reality interfaces and how they work, as well as how well they help to immerse the player in the game world. The author goes on to evaluate two virtual reality games that both use HMD's (Head Mounted Display) but which use different forms of user input, one using an xbox controller and the other using the popular Hydra motion controllers. The results of his tests showed that students were more comfortable using the xbox controller, however after they were given tutorial sessions with the Hydra they actually prefered this. The users that weren't studying technology courses also agreed that users should be familiar with the hardware if they are to enjoy it to its fullest. The author proceeds to talk about motion sickness with virtual reality and concludes that this is down to the game having a lot of action however fails to mention how players move around in the games which is a key factor in my opinion. The paper predicts that following its release several new technologies will launch that will improve VR dramatically and allow for full body motion capture, I find this very interesting as I recently looked at how Bethesda implemented VR in Fallout 4 and noticed that you still have to use a joystick to move around.
